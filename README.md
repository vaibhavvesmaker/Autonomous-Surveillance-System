# Autonomous System Project

## Overview

This project implements an autonomous system using computer vision and deep learning techniques for object detection and tracking.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv4 model for real-time object detection.
- **Object Tracking:** Implements SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for tracking detected objects.
- **Video Processing:** Processes live video streams from a camera or pre-recorded videos.
- **User Interface:** Provides a simple GUI for visualization and control.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (version X.X)
- NumPy (version X.X)
- YOLOv4 model weights (`yolov4.weights`) and configuration file (`yolov4.cfg`)
- COCO dataset classes file (`coco.names`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download YOLOv4 model files and COCO dataset classes file.

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow on-screen instructions to start the autonomous system.

## Configuration

- Adjust parameters in `config.py` for camera settings, model paths, and tracking parameters.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with improvements.
